# ðŸŽ‰ Welcome Contributors!

We would **love** to have you suggest ideas for this list. Here are our guidelines:

## If in doubt, ask - we're friendly

Some communities can be a little intimidating, and we want to make it as inclusive as possible.

We want to encourage you to suggest useful additions to this list. If you want any help or to ask about something, just email james-os@hiberly.com, and I'll get back to you asap!

## Look for original sources

There are lots of articles that just repeat other articles. Try to get to the bottom of this chain with the suggestions you make - don't give an article quoting another article, get the one it all started with. However, if the article you submit adds considerable value, that's ok.

## We prefer non-commercial content

We've chosen to publish this as open source to keep things more neutral.

It can be unavoidable to have a certain degree of commercial content - the quality bar needs to be higher for it to be included. For example, we decided to include the [PagerDuty toolbox](https://postmortems.pagerduty.com/), because it is high enough quality.

Pro-tip: with research papers, many of them are gated behind a paywall, but are then freely available elsewhere on the web, please have a look first and make it clear if the resources is a paid paper.

## Link to the author where possible

If people are putting great stuff out there, they deserve credit! Make an attempt to link to the author in the description of the piece. We've defaulted to Twitter, but a personal website, GitHub profile or LinkedIn could all help people get in touch if they want to.

## Label the content type

Our preference is to find written content as it is usually the most practical to digest. However, failing that, other forms of content where they are very strong are fine. In particular, if there is a book that you feel is the best source of truth for a topic, do add it but please make clear that it is a book and needs buying!

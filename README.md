[Classifying Technical Debt](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html)

* [Martin Fowler](https://twitter.com/martinfowler) makes two disctions (1) prudent and reckless debt, and (2) deliberate and inadvertent debt. A classic

* [Henrik Kniberg](https://twitter.com/henrikkniberg) argues that older tech debt is bad, whereas new tech debt is acceptable in order to build prototypes.
* Concept of a qualitative debt ceiling technique to manage the level of technical debt.

[The Human Cost of Technical Debt?](https://daedtech.com/human-cost-tech-debt/)

* [Erik Dietrick](https://twitter.com/DaedTech) goes into depth for how technical debt can harm teams.
* There includes discussion on (1) unpleasant work (2) team infighting (3) atrophied skills (4) turnover and attrition.

### ü§ù Requirements

[Creating a Product Canvas](https://www.ebgconsulting.com/blog/using-product-canvas-define-product-getting-started/)

* [Ellen Gottesdiener](https://twitter.com/ellengott) provides a canvas to convey what the product is, and how it is strategically positioned.

* The second part of the template is used to explain product requirements.

[Story Mapping](https://www.jpattonassociates.com/the-new-backlog/)

* [Jeff Patton](https://twitter.com/jeffpatton) invented the concept of Story Mapping (you can see a [video of this process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzaCaW8c3qE) here) 
* Flat product story backlogs are hard to understand - they are just a pile of features. By visualising an entire system with it can be much easier to spot opportunities or weaknesses, or indeed to work with other stakeholders in requirements gathering.
* Create a series of cards with big stories (activities) at the top, down to tasks and then sub tasks.

[Joint Application Design](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/determining-project-requirements-best-practices-7278)

Hiberly prioritizes tech debt by grabbing feedback from developers after each merge.

You can then draw cool graphs of your code versus happiness / frustration to help explain the impact of refactoring.
